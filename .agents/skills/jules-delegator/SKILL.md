# Jules Delegator (CLI-Based)

Delegate complex tasks to Jules using the official CLI.

## When to Use

- Complex feature implementations that span multiple files.
- Refactoring large modules.
- Implementing complex bug fixes.
- Delegating work to run autonomously while you focus on other tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Jules CLI installed (`npm install -g @google/jules`)
- Authenticated with Google (`jules login`)

## Core Loop

1. **Prepare Context**: Detect repository and branch.
2. **Delegate**: Create a new session with a clear prompt.
3. **Monitor**: Check session status.
4. **Pull**: Retrieve results when complete.
5. **Review**: Launch TUI for visual diff and confirmation.

## Workflow

### 1. Authenticate

Ensure you are logged in:

```bash
jules login
```

### 2. Detect Context

Auto-detect repository using `git remote get-url origin`.

### 3. Create Session

Start a new autonomous session:

```bash
# In repo directory (auto-detects repo)
jules remote new --session "Add OAuth2 authentication to the API"

# For specific repo
jules remote new --repo owner/repo --session "Implement dark mode"
```

### 4. Monitor Sessions

Check the status of your active sessions:

```bash
jules remote list --session
```

### 5. Retrieve Results

Pull changes once the session is completed:

```bash
jules remote pull --session <session_id>
```

### 6. Interactive Mode

Launch the TUI for a visual experience:

```bash
jules
```

## 7. Post-Pull Normalization (REQUIRED)

**`google-labs-jules[bot]` does not produce conventional commit messages.**
It writes prose ("I've hardened the `check-adr-compliance.sh` …") that
fails `commitlint` (header-max-length, type-empty, subject-empty). See
ADR-008 and PR #505 run 27086771117. **Never push a Jules session's branch
without normalization.**

After `jules remote pull --session <id>`, before pushing or letting any
PR open:

```bash
# 1. Verify the branch is clean
git status --porcelain

# 2. For each non-conventional commit in the Jules branch, rewrite it.
#    Find the merge-base and the head:
BASE="$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)"
HEAD="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"

# 3. Auto-rewriter (see .agents/skills/jules-delegator/scripts/normalize-commits.sh):
./.agents/skills/jules-delegator/scripts/normalize-commits.sh \
    --from "$BASE" \
    --to   "$HEAD" \
    --type fix \
    --scope security

# 4. Force-push the rewritten branch (Jules session branches are disposable).
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>

# 5. Validate locally before requesting review.
./scripts/validate-commit-message.sh <(git log -1 --pretty=%B)
```

The rewriter:

- Keeps the first line of the body intact.
- Replaces the subject with `type(scope): <imperative, ≤72 chars>` derived
  from the diff (e.g. "hardened `check-adr-compliance.sh`" →
  `fix(security): harden check-adr-compliance.sh against injection`).
- Drops lines longer than the 100-char body wrap limit.
- Strips `Co-authored-by:` trailers (the human's `d-o-hub` trailer is
  re-added by the rewriter to preserve attribution).

## CLI Commands Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `jules login` | Authenticate with Google |
| `jules logout` | Sign out from Google |
| `jules remote list --repo` | List connected repositories |
| `jules remote list --session` | List active/past sessions |
| `jules remote new --repo <r> --session "<p>"` | Start a new session |
| `jules remote pull --session <id>` | Pull results from a session |
| `jules completion <bash\|zsh>` | Generate autocompletion script |
| `jules` | Launch interactive TUI |

## Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "I can do this faster manually" | Delegation allows for parallel progress and autonomous implementation of complex features. |
| "Setting up the CLI is too much work" | Authentication is one-time, and auto-detection simplifies session creation. |
| "Jules already validated its work, I don't need to re-validate" | Jules has no knowledge of `commitlint.config.cjs` and will produce prose commits; without normalization the PR is blocked at CI. |
| "I can just edit the PR title to make it pass" | The PR title is the squash-merge subject, but the **commits** in the PR are also linted (see `commitlint` job in `.github/workflows/commitlint.yml`). Title-only fixes leave the bot commits failing. |
| "Force-pushing a Jules branch is unsafe" | Jules session branches are disposable by design; the merge base is the same. |

## Red Flags

- [ ] Forgetting to pull results after a session is completed.
- [ ] Providing vague prompts that lead to incorrect implementations.
- [ ] Not verifying local context before session creation.
- [ ] Pushing a Jules session's branch without running the Post-Pull Normalization step.
- [ ] Opening a PR from a Jules session without first running `npx commitlint --from <base> --to <head>`.
