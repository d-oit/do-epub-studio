# Project Learnings

> Aggregated non-obvious discoveries - loaded on demand via `learn` skill.

## Learnings Capture Rules

### What to Capture

- Hidden file relationships not obvious from code
- Execution paths that differ from what code appears to do
- Non-obvious config, env vars, or flags
- Misleading error messages and debugging breakthroughs
- Files that must change together
- Build/test commands not documented elsewhere
- Architectural constraints discovered at runtime

### What NOT to Capture

- Obvious documentation or standard behavior
- Duplicates of existing entries
- Verbose explanations or session-specific notes

### Scoping

| Scope           | Location                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Project-wide    | `agents-docs/LEARNINGS.md`        |
| Script-specific | `scripts/AGENTS.md`               |
| Skill-specific  | `.agents/skills/<name>/AGENTS.md` |
| Plan-specific   | `plans/AGENTS.md`                 |

## Learnings (Project-Wide)

- **Vitest**: `turbo run test` hangs if any package uses bare `vitest`; always pass `--run` so CI exits cleanly.
- **Swarm Deliverables**: `plans/analysis-*.md` assumes `analysis/SWARM_ANALYSIS.md` exists; keep that file updated after every multi-agent audit so downstream tasks find the aggregated report.
- **EPUB.js + TypeScript**: epubjs types expect non-null refs; capture in local variable before passing to `renderTo()` to avoid TS2769 errors.
- **IndexedDB getAllFromIndex**: idb's `getAllFromIndex` with boolean `false` as value fails - use `.getAll().then(filter())` instead.
- **Duplicate exports**: Don't export same function from multiple modules in a package; TS reports "has already exported a member" error.
